Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }
```

Q: Can you return this dataframe but with the 13th and 18th columns rewritten as standardised skills with a maximum of 30 unique skills accross all lines?
Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.
